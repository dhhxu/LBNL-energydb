Script directory: ~/scripts

MAIN SCRIPTS:

    DESCRIPTION:
    The three most important scripts:

    1. ion_get_data.py (getter)
    Given an input file of information on desired meters, pulls meter data
    from the ION database.

    2. jci_get_data.py (getter)
    Same as above script, except for JCI meters. Note that the input file
    has a different structure (details found in usage)

    3. load_data_files.py (loader)
    Loads data pulled from the JCI and ION data getter scripts into the
    Postgres database holding building energy data. Note that the extracted
    data is of a specific format independent of database source.


    USAGE DETAILS:
    Run the getter script(s) to get desired data. Next run the loader script
    to import the extracted data into the Postgres database.

    For now, it is assumed that the information provided in the input files
    for the getter scripts pertain to new meters, i.e. meters for which the
    data is being pulled for the first time. Furthermore, the time period
    for meter readings must be specified in advance.

    A possible addition would be an 'updater' script that given a meter in
    the Postgres database would fetch new readings for that meter.



OTHER SCRIPTS:

    ion_run_sql.py
    jci_run_sql.py

    DESCRIPTION:
    Both scripts simply run the SQL in an input file on the corresponding
    database. The path to the SQL file must be specified. Generally, the
    SQLs are located in the ~/sql directory
